Imports from lines 3->21 will throw errors in VS code, they work on the cubesat but are not present on a basic computer and as such, will cause errors
All of the board definitions from lines 50->109 are as they should be. 
Unless you change the physical structure of the cubesat and where different components are soldered, they should remain the same
the "componentName = None" lines from 112->122 are simply defining variables so that they can be assigned their propper classes
There should be no errors from the fact that they are defined as none and later refferenced.
Lines 143 -> 499 are copy/paste class definitions for each type of component on the cubesat. 
Each as an __init__() function that is the constructor
